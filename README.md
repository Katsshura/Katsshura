## Hello, how you doing? ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, my name is Emerson Alves and I'm a Software Engineer. I've been fascinated by programming since I first joined college and since that time i've never stopped learning about this world of technology. 

On the pins bellow you can find the projects I've build that I'm most proud of. Each one of them had some key learning or a difficulty that had to be overcome. 

Feel free to leave your constructive opnion in any of my projects ðŸ’™
